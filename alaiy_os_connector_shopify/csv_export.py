"""CSV export for callers holding rows rather than a question.

Every other read here answers in JSON, and a caller turns that into prose. When
someone wants the rows themselves -- a spreadsheet of every listing with no
image, a price list to send on, a register page to work through offline -- prose
is the wrong shape, and pasting the commas into the reply is worse. This takes
JSON that has already been read and writes a real CSV.

The file is saved as a private Frappe File and its `file_url` comes back in the
result, which is the whole of the delivery: an agent pack runs through
alaiy_os's `engine/executor.py`, which has no channel to push a file down.
(alaiy_os's own `chat/artifacts.py` does have one -- a download chip drained by
the chat runner -- so if this is ever called from inside a chat turn, that is the
mechanism to switch to, not a second copy of it here.)

Ported from the Amazon connector's `csv_export.py`, whose row-shape heuristic
this keeps; the envelope threshold below is the one number that had to be
re-derived, because this pack's envelopes are not that pack's. The copies are
separate on purpose -- neither app depends on the other, and a shared helper
would need a third app to live in.

## Not the same thing as api/export.py

`api/export.py:export_listings_csv` also writes a CSV of listings, and the two
must not be merged. That one has a fixed 22-column schema (`_COLUMNS`) which is
the *input contract* of `api/update_listings.py`: a merchant exports it, edits
it, and uploads it back. Its columns cannot drift without breaking the round
trip, it reads the database itself rather than taking rows, and it delivers over
HTTP (`frappe.response.type = "download"`) or `publish_realtime` to a browser.

This one takes arbitrary rows as an argument, has no fixed schema, guards cells
against formula injection, and returns a URL. Folding them together would put
the round-trip schema at the mercy of the guard, and would give the round trip a
delivery path an agent run cannot reach.

This writes no Shopify state and reads nothing from Shopify. It is the only
write in the app's agent pack, and it writes a File.

# its `buckets` in period/currency/totals/coverage. Anything lower would export
# the summary line instead of the rows it summarises.
#
# The number is load-bearing in the other direction too, and less obviously.
# `get_listing` is a *record* that carries nested `variants`, `images` and
# `metafields` lists, and it stays one row only because it has more than five
# scalar fields of its own. That is why every scalar a sales result reports is
# nested under `period`, `totals` or `coverage` rather than sitting at the top
# level: one more top-level key on `get_sales_summary` would take it to five,
