"""Fill the Attributes and Variants child tables from the JSON they were read from.

Both were JSON fields on Shopify Enriched Listing before; they are now child tables,
so a reviewer reads and edits rows instead of a blob — and, for attributes, so what
the reviewer edits is what approval publishes. Listings enriched before that change
have the JSON and nothing else, and would show two empty tables until the agent
re-ran over them.

The JSON fields are left exactly as they are: they are the agent's own words, kept
for audit, and the tables are a second copy rather than a replacement.

Rows are inserted directly rather than through the parent document. Saving the parent
would fire ShopifyEnrichedListing.on_update on every historical listing, and a
migration has no business touching what is or is not published.
