"""
The `generate_product_images` tool: every product photo, retouched.

One of the two image steps this app ships. Both are always registered; the agent's
prompt is what decides which it calls.

What this step is, and what it deliberately is not. It takes each photo the product
already has and returns a cleaner version of that same photo — even lighting, true
colour, no dust or glare, a tidy background. It does NOT compose new shots. An
earlier version of this tool asked the model for a five-shot editorial set (hero,
detail, angle, lifestyle, scale) built by editing one reference photo; handed a
photo plus a rich brief, an image model re-renders an idealised lookalike rather
than editing the real piece, and a luxury resale catalog cannot ship a photo of
something the customer will not receive. So the briefs are gone: there is no shot
vocabulary, nothing for the model to compose, and one fixed retouch instruction
(enhance_prompt) that every photo goes through unchanged.

That also means the model no longer chooses what imagery exists. It calls the tool;
the tool processes whatever photos the product has.

The rendering itself goes through Alaiy OS core's `ai_client` seam
(`llm.generate_image`), the same seam the agent's text turns use. This app holds
no provider credential and names no image model: on a managed bench the call is
served by the billing service, which owns the key and meters the spend; on a BYOK
bench core's default client uses that site's own `openrouter_api_key`.

Each enhanced photo is stored as its own public File, so the original is never
overwritten and a bad result is always recoverable.

Two halves, split across two stages. `generate_product_images` runs inside the
agent's run: it decides whether enhancement happens at all, and queues it. The
actual rendering is `render_generated`, which runs later on the image queue — see
image_stage.py for why.

    Queue a product's photos to be retouched, and return immediately. Returns
    {"images": [{source_url, item_variant, url, note}, ...]} — copy that list
    verbatim into the final `images` array.

    `url` comes back null: the photos are enhanced after this run finishes, by
    image_stage.run_step, and attached to the listing then. That is by design — a
    set of images takes minutes, and holding the run open for it would block a
    worker that could be enriching other products. The rendering itself is
    render_generated() below, which goes through core's `ai_client` seam
    (llm.generate_image) and saves each result as its own public File.

    EVERY photo is enhanced: the listing's own PLUS each enabled variant's
    `variant_image`, under the one toggle, with no per-product cap. A URL shared by
    the listing and a variant (or by two variants) is paid for once — one render
    fills every row that references it.

    Which photo belongs to which variant is settled HERE, in code, and travels with
    the queued job: stage two writes the rows from that plan, not from the `images`
    array the model returns. So a variant's enhanced photo reaches its variant even
    if the model drops the entry, or drops its `item_variant`, on the way out. The
    entries returned below are the same plan, for the model to report — its copy of
    the truth, not the truth itself.

    A row's `item_variant` is what routes the result to that variant's
    `variant_image` when an admin approves the listing (see
    ShopifyEnrichedListing._sync_variant_images); nothing is written to the Shopify
    Product Listing before that approval.

    The exception is a URL-only product: it has no listing record for stage two to
    deliver into, so its photos are enhanced inline and come back with real urls.

    Whether we enhance at all is decided HERE, deterministically — not left to the
    model's judgement — by three gates:

      1. There must be at least one existing photo. For an item_code run those are
         the listing's own photos (read from the Shopify Product Listing's images
         table) plus its enabled variants'; for a URL-only product they are
         image_urls. No photos → empty list, nothing done. This gate is airtight: it
         holds regardless of what the model passes, and it is why this agent can
         never produce imagery for a product it has no photograph of.
      2. Enhancement is opt-in per request: generate_images must be true. When
         photos exist but the toggle is off, we return empty too.
      3. A photo already enhanced on an earlier run is never enhanced again — its
         existing result is returned as-is. This is per photo, not per product, so a
         listing that gained a photo only pays for the new one. A photo that FAILED
         has no url and so is not "already enhanced": it is retried.

    Per-image failures degrade rather than raise: that entry comes back with
    url=None and a note, and the remaining photos still process. If the site's AI
    client cannot generate images at all (and both gates pass), the model is told
    via the thrown message not to retry and to fall back to url=null placeholders
    instead of stalling the rest of the listing.

    `source_urls` and `force` are for the per-photo endpoint
    (api.enrich_listing_image), not for the model. They are deliberately absent from
    the tool's declared schema in the listing agent, so a run can neither narrow the work
    nor bypass gate 3 — an agent enriching a product always covers all of its photos,
    and never pays twice. `source_urls` narrows the resolved targets to those photos
    (every use of each still travels, so a shared photo still fills every row it
    belongs to); `force` skips the gate 3 lookup so a photo a reviewer was unhappy
    with can be rendered again.

    `reference_image_url` and `**_retired` are compatibility, not API. This tool used
    to take `briefs` and a single `reference_image_url`; a site whose OS Agent
    Registry has not been re-synced since still advertises those, and a model will
    occasionally reach for them from habit either way. Retired arguments are ignored
    (there are no briefs to honour), and a lone reference url is treated as the
    URL-only product's one photo rather than dropped.

    composing from a description.

    pure pixel work with no site context to need and this thread is otherwise idle
    the whole time — compositing a whole product's photos in series afterwards would
    add that time to every job for no reason. When the site has no house style, or
