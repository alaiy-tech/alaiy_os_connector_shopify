"""Stage two: the images, rendered after the listing text is already saved.

The agent's run is stage one. It reads the product, writes the listing, and — when
an image toggle is on — resolves *which photos* the work applies to: the ones to
retouch, or the ones to translate. It does not wait for that imagery. The image tool
returns placeholders with ``url: None`` and queues the work here, so a run finishes
in the ~35s its LLM turns actually take instead of the ~5 minutes the image API
takes.

Why split at all: the two halves have opposite shapes. Stage one is LLM-bound and
short; stage two is minutes of pure HTTP waiting on a paid image service. Sharing
one worker pool means a single image product holds a slot that could have cleared
nine text listings, and it delays the listing text — the part a human actually
reviews — behind imagery they will look at later.

The handoff is deliberately not a protocol the model can corrupt. The tool enqueues
the job itself with ``enqueue_after_commit=True``, so it fires on ``save_listing``'s
commit — the enriched listing is guaranteed to exist by then — and is dropped
entirely if the run fails first, because ``db.rollback()`` resets the after-commit
callbacks. Everything stage two needs travels in the job's own arguments; nothing is
reconstructed by guessing at saved rows.

    Both steps deliver one entry PER USE of a photo (see render_generated and
