"""
Image plumbing shared by the agent's two image tools.

Nothing here is a tool: these are the primitives the image tools are built out
of. The base app deliberately ships NO image tool of its own — what counts as
"the image step" differs per customer (The Solist generates editorial shots; naya
translates the Chinese text printed on supplier photos), and that judgement
belongs in the customer app. What is genuinely common is everything around it:
turning a photo into something the model can see, and re-hosting a result so it
survives.

The provider CALLS are no longer part of that split. Both image steps now go
through Alaiy OS core's `ai_client` seam, so no app on the bench holds a provider
credential or speaks a provider's wire format — the managed client serves both
via the billing service. What stays here is the local half the seam cannot do:
reading a Frappe File, and writing one back.

Names here are public (no leading underscore) because the tool modules import them.
