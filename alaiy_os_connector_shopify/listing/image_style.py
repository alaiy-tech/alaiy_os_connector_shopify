The house studio finish: the part of a listing photo that must NOT be left to a model.

A retouched photograph and a catalog photograph are different things. The retouch —
even lighting, true colour, no dust — is judgement about a specific piece, and an
image model is good at it. The house look is the opposite: an exact background hex,
the same margin on every product, the same shadow at the same angle on all of them.
Ask a model for `#f4f4f4` and you get a grey near it, a different grey on the next
photo, and a margin that drifts with whatever it thought the composition wanted. So
the model is asked for the product on an empty white ground and nothing else, and
everything measurable is composited here, in code.

Two things live in this module:

  * `load()` — the style spec, contributed by the client app through the
    `listing_image_style` hook, exactly the way the attribute matrix arrives (see
    matrix.py). A look belongs to the store, not to this app: The Solist's catalog
    is light grey with a hard, light shadow; another client's is not, and a base app
    that hardcodes one customer's brand guidelines is a base app no one else can
    install. No provider means no finish, which is this app's behaviour to date.

  * `apply_finish()` — the compositor. Free of Frappe, so it can run on a worker
    thread; pure Pillow apart from the matte.

How the product is separated from its background is the one real choice in here,
and there are two ways:

  * `segment` — a segmentation model (rembg / ISNet) computes an alpha mask. It
    reads the photo and outputs an opacity per pixel; it does not draw anything.
    The product's own pixels are carried through untouched, which is the whole
    reason this is the default: the background is altered and the product is not,
    by construction rather than by asking a generative model nicely.
  * `flood` — fill inward from the frame edge over near-white pixels. No model, no
    dependency, and no cost, but it only works on a photo that is ALREADY on a
    clean, even, pale ground. Kept for exactly that case.

Either way the compositor refuses rather than guesses: if what comes back is not a
believable separation, the original image is returned with a note a reviewer can
read. A mangled photo of a $40k watch is worse than an unfinished one.

## Why this lives in the connector

It came from `alaiy_os_agent_shopify_listing`, now retired. The image step is the
channel's — Shopify is the only channel that declares a `prepare_images` handler
— so the whole producing side moved here with it, this module included.

The look itself does NOT belong to any app here. It arrives from the client app
through the `listing_image_style` hook, the same seam `matrix.py` uses for the
mandatory-attribute guideline, and both are read the same way for the same
reason: what a specific seller's catalogue looks like is that seller's business,
and a connector every Shopify site installs must not carry one store's brand
guidelines. No provider means no finish.

    # framing and its own resolution. Padding is a FLOOR on the empty space, never a
