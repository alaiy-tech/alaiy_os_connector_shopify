"""
The client's mandatory-attribute matrix, as this app sees it.

A listing agent's attribute rules belong to the seller, not to this app: what
"mandatory" means for a luxury watch marketplace is nothing like what it means
for a homeware store. So the rules arrive at runtime from whichever client app is
installed, through the `listing_attribute_matrix` hook, and this module is the
only thing here that knows the hook exists.

    # in the client app's hooks.py
    listing_attribute_matrix = ["<client_app>.agents.attribute_matrix.matrix"]

Why a hook, when the seller's prompt override (`alaiy_os_agents`'
`agents/listing/meta.find_override`) is just "does the file exist": that override
is prose, and the worst a bad one does is read oddly. This is executable policy
-- it gates a write path and reshapes the fields the channel spec hands the model
-- so it wants a declared owner and a validated contract, the way
`alaiy_os_agents/agents/listing/channels.py` handles the same kind of
contribution.

Everything here degrades to "no matrix" when no client provides one, so this
connector still installs and runs on a bench with no client app at all.
`match_keys` and `is_placeholder` are the exception: they are generic text
handling, not client policy, and work either way.
