"""
The four catalog tools: read the product, look at a photo, read the store's existing
vocabulary, save the result.

Each callable here is reached by dotted path through listing/channel.py's adapter and
invoked by the Alaiy OS executor's tool loop as ``handler(**tool_input)``. A
handler either:

  • returns JSON-serializable data (dict/list/str/…), which is sent back to the
    model as the tool_result, or
  • returns a dict with a "_content_blocks" key holding ready-made Anthropic
    content blocks — used here so the model can actually *see* the product
    photos (vision), not just read their URLs.

Raising is fine: the executor catches the exception and feeds it back to the
model as an errored tool_result. We still prefer to degrade gracefully (skip an
unreadable image, guard optional rows) so a single bad attachment does not sink
the whole enrichment.

The source of truth read here is the **Shopify Product Listing** DocType (its
`name` is the template item_code, autoname: field:item), NOT the Item — the
listing's own fields (title, description, price, variants) and its `images` child
table are all we look at. The agent does not edit the listing (or the Item behind
it) and does not publish to Shopify — that is the admin approval / connector step.

save_listing persists the finished enrichment into the Shopify Enriched Listing
DocType in "Needs Review" status, for the admin to edit and approve.

def save_listing(listing, item_code=None):
    """
    Persist an enriched listing into the shared Shopify Enriched Listing DocType
    for admin review. Upserts by item_code (one row per product): re-running a
    listing agent on the same product updates the existing row instead of creating
    a duplicate.

    `listing` is the full enrichment object — the same shape the agent returns
    (schemas/output.json). `item_code` identifies the source product
    and is the upsert key; it falls back to listing["item_code"] if not passed
    separately. The row lands in "Needs Review" status so an admin edits/approves
    it before anything is published.

    Every field written here corresponds to a field on the Shopify Product Listing
    itself (title -> listing_title, description -> listing_description, category ->
    listing_category, product_type -> listing_product_type, seo_title ->
    listing_seo_title, seo_description -> listing_seo_description, attributes ->
    metafields, images -> images) or on the Item (shopify_tags -> sh_shopify_tags —
    tags are Item-level, not a listing field), plus the three review fields the
    approval step needs. The agent produces nothing else.

    List-valued fields (needs_review, notes) are flattened to one-per-line text for a
    readable Desk form. The structured parts — attributes and per-variant
    observations — are written BOTH as child tables, which is what the Desk form
    shows and what an admin edits, AND verbatim as JSON, which is the audit copy. The
    whole payload is kept as JSON too, so nothing is lost even if the flattened
    fields drift from the schema.

    A variant row links to its variant Item; a variant the model named that is not an
    Item is skipped rather than allowed to fail the save, since variants_json holds
    it either way.

    Image rows use one shape — {kind, item_variant, source_url, url, brief, note},
    each column optional — so a single child table serves both image steps, and rows
    written by older versions of either keep rendering. (`kind` and `brief` are what
    the retired five-shot generator wrote; nothing produces them now.) A row with
    item_variant set is a
    variant's image (delivered to that variant's `variant_image` on approval); it
    shares the listing's image_status rather than having a lifecycle of its own. The
    per-variant observations land in the `variants` table, review material only.

    Nothing the model sends is allowed to fail this save if the listing can be
    written at all. A value the DocType would reject is clamped and the reviewer
    told (see _select_value, _clamp_data); a value that is really a note about
    not having the value is blanked and flagged (matrix.is_placeholder); and any
    mandatory attribute left out of both `attributes` and `needs_review` is
    appended to `needs_review` (_flag_missing_mandatory). An attribute the
    product already publishes is none of those things — it is filled, and saying
    otherwise sends the reviewer after a value that is already live. All of it exists
    because the alternative — refusing the call — makes the model rebuild the
    payload, and a rebuilt payload silently drops attributes it had already got
    right. `output_json` keeps the agent's own words regardless, so a clamp
    loses nothing but the reviewer's time.

    Which attributes are mandatory is the client's business, not this app's: it
    arrives through the `listing_attribute_matrix` hook. See matrix.py.

    Returns {name, status, url} pointing at the new/updated record.
