Where each attribute on an enriched listing actually came from.

The prompt describes an evidence ladder — what the product already publishes,
then the store's other records of it, then the listing text, then the photos,
then a competitor page, and only then `needs_review`. A reviewer reading the
finished grid cannot see any of that: `water_resistance: 30 m` looks identical
whether it was copied off a metafield the store has held for a year or read off
a watch forum thirty seconds ago, and those deserve very different amounts of
trust.

This module works the rung out **from the evidence, not from the model's
account of it**. That distinction is the whole point. The override prompt spends
three paragraphs telling the agent not to write "confirmed via manufacturer
sources" over a value it never sourced, which is a real failure and exactly the
kind a prompt cannot prevent on its own — a model that would invent the value
will invent the citation beside it. So nothing here asks the model where a value
came from:

  * `published` and `revised` are decided by comparing the value against what
    the store already holds, which this app can read for itself. A run proposing
    to overwrite a live value never reads as a confirmation of it.
  * `metafield` is the store's own record of the value under another name.
  * `web` is granted only when the value literally appears in the text of a page
    `view_competitor_page` really fetched during this run. A URL the model cites
    but never opened earns nothing.
  * `product` is the residual: no store record and no fetched page contains it,
    so the agent derived it from the listing's own text or its photos. Those two
    are not distinguishable from outside the model, and pretending otherwise
    would be its own small lie — they are reported together as the product's own
    evidence.

`unsourced_claims` closes the loop the other way: URLs the agent named in its
`notes` that appear in no fetched page. That is the invented citation, caught
mechanically, and it is worth surfacing precisely because it reads as verified.

## Why this is the channel's and the web tools are not

Deciding the rung means reading what *this store* already publishes — the
product's metafields, under this channel's own namespaces, compared with
this channel's value-matching rules. That is Shopify knowledge and it belongs
here. Fetching a competitor page is not, so the tools that do it live in
`alaiy_os_agents` and hand their record over through `websearch.research_record`
— see that module for why the record travels on `frappe.flags` rather than
being read back from the run.
