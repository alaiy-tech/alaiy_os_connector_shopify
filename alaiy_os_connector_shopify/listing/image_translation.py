"""
The `translate_product_images` tool: supplier photos with their printed Chinese
text rendered into English.

One of the two image steps this app ships. It does not retouch photos — that
is `generate_product_images`, a deliberately different capability. Both are always
registered; the listing agent's prompt is what decides which it calls.

The translation itself goes through Alaiy OS core's `ai_client` seam
(`llm.translate_image`), the same seam the agent's text turns use. This app holds
no vendor credential: on a managed bench the call is served by the billing
service, which owns the alphashop key and meters the spend. A BYOK bench has no
translation provider and the tool reports that rather than half-working.

Each translated photo is stored as its own public File, so the original supplier
photo is never overwritten and a bad translation is always recoverable.

Two halves, split across two stages. `translate_product_images` runs inside the
agent's run: it decides whether translation happens at all, and queues it. The
actual work is `render_translated`, which runs later on the image queue — see
image_stage.py for why.

    """
    Queue a product's supplier photos to have their printed Chinese text rendered
    into English, and return immediately. Returns
    {"images": [{source_url, url, note}, ...]} — copy that list verbatim into the
    final `images` array.

    `url` comes back null: the photos are translated after this run finishes, by
    image_stage.run_step, and attached to the listing then. That is by design — the
    translation service takes minutes, and holding the run open for it would block
    a worker that could be enriching other products. The work itself is
    render_translated() below, which goes through core's `ai_client` seam
    (llm.translate_image) and re-hosts each result.

    EVERY photo is translated: the listing's own PLUS each enabled variant's
    `variant_image`, under the one toggle, with no per-product cap. A URL shared by
    the listing and a variant (or by two variants) is paid for once — one translation
    fills every row that references it.

    Which photo belongs to which variant is settled HERE, in code, and travels with
    the queued job: stage two writes the rows from that plan, not from the `images`
    array the model returns. So a variant's translated photo reaches its variant even
    if the model drops the entry, or drops its `item_variant`, on the way out. The
    entries returned below are the same plan, for the model to report — they are its
    copy of the truth, not the truth itself.

    A row's `item_variant` is what routes the result to that variant's
    `variant_image` when an admin approves the listing (see
    ShopifyEnrichedListing._sync_variant_images); nothing is written to the Shopify
    Product Listing before that approval.

    The exception is a URL-only product: it has no listing record for stage two to
    deliver into, so its photos are translated inline and come back with real urls.

    Whether we translate at all is decided HERE, deterministically — not left to the
    model's judgement — by two gates:

      1. There must be at least one photo to translate. For an item_code run those
         are the listing's own photos (read from the Shopify Product Listing's images
         table); for a URL-only product they are image_urls. No photos → empty list,
         nothing done. This gate is airtight: it holds regardless of what the model
         passes.
      2. Translation is opt-in per request: translate_images must be true. When
         photos exist but the toggle is off, we return empty too.
      3. A photo already translated on an earlier run is never translated again —
         its existing result is returned as-is. This is per photo, not per product,
         so a listing that gained a photo only pays for the new one. A photo that
         FAILED has no url and so is not "already translated": it is retried.

    Per-image failures degrade rather than raise: that entry comes back with
    url=None and a note, and the remaining photos still process. If the service
    isn't configured at all (and both gates pass), the model is told via the thrown
    message not to retry and to fall back to null placeholders instead of stalling
    the rest of the listing.
